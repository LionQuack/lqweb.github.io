   <h4>Tessle Phase 1</h4>
    <p>Q1 -- What is The difference between ideas of Modularity and Tessellation? What are the properties that are in opposition with each other? 
        <br> <br>
	Between modularity and tessellation the difference is the system that they hold fundamentally. Modularity is a system that has interchangeable components; that could be arranged in many ways. For tessellation a systems that holds itself like modularity, with the interchangeable components, but the difference is that itâ€™s limited to a design based on a mathematics. Being limited to a mathematical pattern, this  property creates a opposition to the idea of modularity. 
<br> <br>
Q2 -- What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic) 
        <br> <br>
	Complexity emerges out of randomness, unpredictable; while uniform is predictable and constant. The difference between these two in design a context, complexity has it irregularities and unknown outcomes, when Uniform is fixed and known outcomes. 
<br> <br>
Q3 -- How might emergent behavior be related to what you are building?
        <br> <br>
	The relationship of the paper tesselations and emergent behavior. I thought of the funky cut-out edges as a simple interaction. A tessellation emerges, which continually traced on paper made a complex pattern.

<h4>Artist Statement</h4>
    <p>
	
		The process of getting the edges to match up was puzzling at first, but after many attempts I got it down. The group decided to work on a theme, but we each did our own separate design in the end since scaling was an issue.  Working with the group was helpful, my classmates had there own designs, a duck and crown. Although I ended up with a funky triangle, I did enjoy the creative experience.
