    <h4>Natural-Born Cyborg Chapter 1 Summary</h4>
    <p>The major elements to summarize was Cyborg unplugged, revisioning the idea of the cyborg, Clarks goes through providing his thoughts and examples about his idea of the cyborg.  Rats in space a brief history of cybernetics, Clynes and Klines. Implant & Mergers he talks about implants and mergers. A Day in the Life he tells us a story of the natural-born cyborg. Then concludes with Dovetailing where he describes the revisioning of the cyborg in today’s technological age.</p>
        
    <p>1. Summarize the distinction(s) from the traditional Klines &  Clines definition of the cyborg vs. the one that Clark is proposing as the main thesis of his book?
        <br><br>
	The distinction between Clynes and Klines cyborg, the idea of a man and machine hybrid vs Clark’s thesis that humans are naturally cyborgs. To first look at Clyne’s after he coins the term as a hybrid artifact-organism system explaining that the cyborg: which have a implanted electronic devices that use feedback signals from the body to regulate themselves to become suited in an alien environment.

        As for Clark, he address that humans are already cyborg’s, a revisioning of hybrid artifact-organism. Although Clark’s proposal similar with Clynes in incorporating and having self-regulating control. But Clark’s was innate, rather than Clynes relying on external components. A distinction is seen with Clark’s as goes deeper into how is a cyborg instead of what a cyborg is. 

        Clark redefines with a how, with how these external tools are reflections of our human mind, the problem-solving systems. This cognitive function, we humans have innately. We make tools that help us with problems, these tool reflect deeply our problem-solving system. Clark’s revisioning of how a cyborg works. </p>
    <p>
        2. From The book, "Cyberneticists were especially interested in self-regulating systems." 
        What are 2 or more example of these, make sure to include both biological systems and also non-biological systems.
        <br><br>
	   Examples of a self-regulating systems including a biological system and a non-biological system. A self-regulating biological system would be photosynthesis, which plant cells convert sunlight with water and nutrients into energy. The self-regulating non-biological system would be a computer’s graphics processor. On the account of when there’s too much stress on the processor, it slows down the computer to prevent itself from overheating.</p>
        
    <p>3. What other kind of definitions of a hybrid humans are there that are not based on definitions above but popular in literature, media culture, etc.
        <br>
	Hybrid humans, a human incorporating features from an animal or having technology attached to themselves. Within popular culture in the scope of literature and media culture hybrid humans have an archetypal prowess. They have features unknown or otherworldly than a human would have.

    <h4>Natural-Born Cyborg Chapter 2 Summary</h4>
        <p>In chapter two, Clark talks about the technologies to bond with as a natural cyborg. He begins talking about his experience with old retro-technology during his visit at Los Alamos. From there he discusses and defines transparent technology and opaque technology. In Transparent Tools, Clark, speaks of Don Norman, where describing the historical progress from the starting point of technology, being technology-centered to being human-centered. The example of the wristwatch, Clark states, to show its historical progress; from opaque to transparent. In Smart Worlds, Clark speaks on how a world is constructed by these transparent technologies the world becoming pseudo-neural. Although problems arise with the  smart world becoming too transparent. A solution comes with tangible computing.</p>
        
        <p>1. Summarize a definition as described in the book of what the significant attributes  are for 'opaque' technology vs.  'transparent' technology. 
        <br><br>
        
	Significant attributes for opaque technology needs skills that doesn’t come naturally, biologically, the user must learn how to interact and operate with opaque technology. While for transparent technology, is dovetailed biologically to the user, which gives them ease of access and usage, an almost invisible interaction.

        </p>
            
        
        <p>2. Give some examples of technology that might be better served if it were more transparent and and also give some example of a technology that should be more opaque.
            <br><br>
        Technologies that better served if it was given a more opaque, I would think of reading tablets, I would enjoy if it has more physicality to it rather than being invisible data. For transparency, I would think of laptop, for the portability element, present-at-hand.  </p>
 


            <p>
3.Does the watch and dictionary example discussed in the book, seem valid to you? Why?
                <br><br>
	Yes, the watch and dictionary example seems valid to me. As Clark concludes chapter two, I focus on our cyborg past and cyborg present, he mentions, depends on tools, techniques, practices, and innovations of the age. How these opaque technologies will become more human-centered, a transparency. The wristwatch example, with its early beginnings of the sundial then clocktower to us moving our arm to answer the question of the time. This externalization of technologies that interweave having a profound and enduring presence in our lives.
